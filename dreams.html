<div id="content" class="container"><h2>Dreams from My Father</h2>

<p><strong>July 2013</strong></p>

<p>I close my eyes, breathing</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>and out</p>

<p>in</p>

<p>and out</p>

<p>until I fall, end-over-end, into a warm cloud.</p>

<p>The cloud sighs and moans around me. Warmth fills me, envelopes me. A good dream.</p>

<p>Soon I'm working through some silly manufactured scenario - a situation that requires my personal expertise, perhaps, or maybe someone I admire has specifically thought of me as being important. It's a fluffy dream, superficial, and ultimately empty.</p>

<p>Until, for some reason, on some level, I'm suddenly aware of the fact that I'm minorly deluding myself. I am interrupted in the midst of responding sagely to some praise, or settling an argument, or something. The thought strikes, like a knife through a painting, and everything falls apart.</p>

<p>Strong hands grab me by the ear, by the hair, and drag me towards the shed in the back yard. The door is dark red, and it smells earthy and dusty inside. The hands belong to shame, or at least shame personified. He closes the door behind him.</p>

<p>I know I've done something wrong - I've been feeding my ego, like he said. It's always about me, isn't it? My own vanity, my own pride, at the expense of everyone else. He's here to remind me that I'm <em>worthless</em>, to punish me for not hating myself.</p>

<p>He towers over me in the dim light. He smells masculine, sour. His arms are thick, and covered in coarse hair. His strength sets off some primal fear in me; I convulse, and my petulant child's tears turn into heavy sobs. I'm wracked with terror, and paralyzed under the force of his anger. Growling something about his duty, he unbuckles his belt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dreams are never explicit this way, of course. Writing about my dream involves anchoring it to imagery from my memories, taking the nebulous miasma that's impossible to describe and giving it substance for you to understand and consume.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ice creeps across the sky, and I wake up. A chill, from the window, on my back. Reality! I gasp at air that's physically cold, grasp at the dry taste in my mouth and the hangover buzzing at my temples. These things remind me that I'm twice that age now, that my stepfather can't hurt me from three thousand miles away.</p>

<p>My face contorts involuntarily, and it feels like some weight is suddenly pressing on my back. I'm confused for a second before I realize what's happening, and something between a cough and a choking sound shudders through me. I can't really remember how to cry effectively, so I just sorta lay there, catatonic, and every once in a while another convulsion moves through me. Some voice in my head ridicules me for being melodramatic, for exaggerating things, for making a big deal out of nothing.</p>

<p>Eventually I check my phone, and realize that I should go back to sleep. So I do.</p>

<hr />

<p>The fear and shame are different things. The physical fear of my stepfather will probably always be with me, to some extent, along with an obnoxious propensity to flinch at sudden movements. The sound of his steps, his posture, his smell, all cause me to tense up like a hunted animal.</p>

<p>The shame is deeper, and harder to understand or cope with. His insistence that I was a fundamentally broken, selfish person left me with a constant undercurrent of self-doubt. His most oft-repeated assertion, that I was incapable of thinking of other people, and hopelessly self-centered, haunts me the most.</p>

<p>Whenever I feel pride, the brief moment of increased self-esteem is tinged with uncertaincy - am I just full of myself? Whenever I hurt someone accidentally, I worry that I must do it constantly, without realizing. I worry that my nature is to use and hurt people.</p>

<p>And writing this - am I just seeking attention? Or self-pitying?</p>

<p>"Character" is not built this way. Fear can harden a person, I think - although that seems to me to be a really brittle strength - but it didn't harden me.</p>
