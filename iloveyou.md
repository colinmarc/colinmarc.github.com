I Love You
==========

**May 2013**

I was walking through the movie theater today, and I stopped to check out some random movie poster. It was some masculine guy, wearing a suit, walking towards the camera, holding a gun or something. He was in a city, or someplace that was very dusty. I don't remember.

The tagline on the poster read: "The Day Started Like Any Other..."

I stood there and actually thought about that for a bit. I'd certainly heard the phrase before in my life; I had a general understanding of the concept; and its associations were pretty clear. But I'd never really *felt* it. This phrase had an actual meaning! I have a routine, day to day - what if it was disrupted by something so impossibly alien and different that it's very happening emphasized how normal the day could have been? What if whatever happened was so strange that I wished for normalcy?

As we get older, language starts to have a lot more meaning. "As we get older" is, in fact, a great example of this.

As a writer, or just someone who reads a lot, it's easy to find yourself using idioms or cliches without really knowing what they mean. You're relying only on the connotations of the phrase, and ignoring the substance. But over time, it becomes easier to fit the growing pile of personal experiences that are accumulating in your life to the words themselves.

Today, I told someone that it was "amazing to see their face" (I hadn't in a while, and it was, truly). That's something that people say in movies, but I said it honestly, unironically. I intended to use the meaning, but not the association. I didn't draw it from this bucket of idioms I know; I constructed it anew, because that's how I felt. Next time I say "I love you," I want it to feel like that.

Poetry has been described as one of the most participatory of artistic mediums. My high school lit teacher said that poetry was an experience half created by the writer and half by the reader. He said that when you read poetry, the dense, packed meanings and feelings all tangled up inside the language are released, and connect with your own experiences in strange and unpredictable ways. Together they make up an experience that's entirely your own.

By contrast, some language is less participatory. I think of film this way - there's a ton of authorial intent, visual, audial, etc - and you don't get to control the speed or pace at which you consume it. With film, you get more of the message, so there's a smaller proportion of the total experience that comes from your own mental landscape.

How would you evaluate the phrase "I love you" by that metric? It's a really strange, unique thing, that phrase. There's a lot happening.

When you say it, you're releasing this flood of emotion - giving it an outlet. "I love you" is how we're trained to express feelings of intimacy, of loyalty, of sexual pleasure, or just of admiration. But you're also taking advantage of all the meaning, the weight behind the phrase itself. That's why you sometimes have to be careful who you say it to. And, I would argue, the trappings of the phrase are mostly what is received in the end.

There's an intangible, psychological heft to the phrase, given to it by the fact that we hear it in movies and on TV and in books and from our parents. It's very similar to the weight attached to hurtful words, like racial slurs. The context and intent matter, sometimes, but often it's not the meaning itself that is transferred; like a molotov cocktail, the language explodes into our imagination, sparking memories and feelings and setting our subconscious alight.

I once listened to a Radiolab episode that talked about different types of memory, and the different theories we have on it. One thing stuck with me in particular: some scientists believe (a great example of idiom-meaning transcending real-meaning is "some scientists believe") that a memory becomes less real the more we access it. You're tasting less and less of that experience time you tap it, because by reliving it, you're actually mixing it up with how you currently feel and then pouring it back into the keg. This is a strange, sad concept.

Maybe language shares the same kind of access-decay? Maybe every time we say "I love you" to the many, many people we love in life, the meaning becomes less about the moment in which we say it and more about all of those moments. Every time it's used, it collects a tiny bit of detritus from the situation it's used in. Eventually, it just becomes this strange blob of meaning and feeling and images from our past, a canvas painted with our colorful memories and textured with the grit of the mundanity of human existence.

Getting older is weird.
