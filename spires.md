spires
------

**April 2013**

There's a strange place a little ways from the town where I grew up. Past the landfill, there's a small little hill that's smoother, rounder than it really should be.

On top of the hill are these little stone spires, maybe twenty of them. They're dark and cold and smooth, like pebbles from a rushing brook, and they stand perfectly straight out of the ground. Some are bluish-black when you look at them a certain way; some are more greenish; most people would just describe them as black. I used to walk among their otherwordly countenance, kicking up red dust from the barren ground, feeling like they were watching me, in awe of just how *alien* they were.

I remember the day my brother died, back when I wasn't yet 12. He was always small and frail, and when the sickness came for him it devoured him in a single bite. I remember his face, all blown up like a balloon, as he laid there on the table dying. I remember vividly thinking it might pop like one, and I should be careful not to touch him.

Our father, alone in many ways, coped in the only way he knew how and drowned himself in drooz. He made wretched, guttural sounds, and wept quietly into his hands, greasy tears that stained his calloused hands purple and brown. I sat apart from him, staring at my little brother, willing him to live, feeling helpless and confused and angry.

Eventually, in that desperate way that children do, I formulated a plan. I waited there in silence for hours as my father muttered to himself. Eventually he slumped over, but even then I forced myself to wait, to be extra careful. I didn't want him stopping me, addled as he was.

Once I was sure his snores were authentic, I crept quietly to the shed and got an ancient pull wagon that we'd had kicking around for as long as I can remember. It was so old that the color had faded from the plastic; it was like a piece of watermelon that's had all the juice sucked out of it. I grabbed my plastic sword, too, and holstered it across my back. I'm not sure it would've offered me protection from anything, but it sure made me feel braver.

The plastic wheels of the wagon would've rattled loudly if I moved quickly, so I pulled it slowly, inch by inch, into the house where my brother was. He made a loud *flump* as I pushed him into the wagon. Trying to quiet my heavy breathing, I pulled him out the door into the still, dry air.

I talked to him softly as I pulled him beneath the stars towards the landfill. I don't know what I said, and I don't know whether he heard me, or even whether he was still alive at that point. And being 5, he probably wouldn't have really understood me. Either way, I'll never know.

We walked through the landfill then, with looming, jagged shapes all around us. I kept my hand on the hilt of my sword just in case. The night was schockingly silent, and very dark, but I knew the way. I'd spent many days there, digging in the dirt, chasing tomb rats with a BB gun, building precarious structures out of scrap metal.

I shivered and grunted as I struggled up the hill with the wagon and the weight of my brother and his disease behind me, but eventually we reached the top.

My plan was to plead with the stones to save my brother; I knew nothing earthly could save him, but maybe whatever divine, alien force had created these perfect columns had the ability to restore his youthful health. But they didn't answer. I screamed at them, kicked them, but they only silently looked back at me, unmoved.

To this day, I still don't understand what those stones were, or who put them there. The mystery of them has stayed with me longer than the grief over my brother; longer than the hatred towards my father; longer than anything else. It's filled me with purpose, compelled me to seek knowledge in the stars, to find answers of some kind. And I have. I've soared far, and seen many things. But nothing like those stones.

That night, as the rising sun started to gently caress the corpse of my child brother, I sat among the stones and cried. And the stones, they howled too.
