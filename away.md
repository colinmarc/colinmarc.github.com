Away
----

<p class="date"><em>March 2013</em></p>

his eyes fell, like his broken sighs  
or, perhaps, raised, to blue-black skies  
where angels only he could reach  
and very few would even seek  
cavorted; but if it was woe,  
or merely something hidden, so?  
he looked away, away, away,  
and that's the only thing - away.  

a narrative born on the moon  
with radiant hair and face in bloom  
swept down from high with brandished sword  
but found herself unjust, abhorred  
and given by a broken lord  
a broken cord, a sultry chord.  
so then that story went away,  
to find, and save, a different day.  

a darkness, then, which seeped unseen,  
brought warriors, wrought in gutted dreams  
who fought and brayed and prayed to crowds  
of fiends within his mind. too loud,  
he thought, to think! the wave clattered,  
flattered, battered, bled and shattered,  
left of its own accord. at bay,  
the chaos went away, away.  

he drew a bead on silence, then,  
and focused on the thread again.  
above horizon, and below,  
there roiled fire, corpse and crow.  
he's safe until he looks away,  
some day, whether to skies or fey, away.
