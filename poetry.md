Away
----

**March 2013**

his eyes fell, like his broken sighs  
or, perhaps, raised, to blue-black skies  
where angels only he could reach  
and very few would even seek  
cavorted; but if it was woe,  
or merely something hidden, so?  
he looked away, away, away,  
and that's the only thing - away.  

a narrative born on the moon  
with radiant hair and face in bloom  
swept down from high with brandished sword  
but found herself unjust, abhorred  
and given by a broken lord  
a broken cord, a sultry chord.  
so then that story went away,  
to find, and save, a different day.  

a darkness, then, which seeped unseen,  
brought warriors, wrought in gutted dreams  
who fought and brayed and prayed to crowds  
of fiends within his mind. too loud,  
he thought, to think! the wave clattered,  
flattered, battered, bled and shattered,  
left of its own accord. at bay,  
the chaos went away, away.  

he drew a bead on silence, then,  
and focused on the thread again.  
above horizon, and below,  
there roiled fire, corpse and crow.  
he's safe until he looks away,  
some day, whether to skies or fey, away.  


Behind Uncertain Doors
----------------------

**February 2012**

The walk to work runs past a store,   
with dollar books by a red door,   
old wood, with paint that chips;  
the flakes stick to the concrete steps,  
and pool beneath the smokey windowpanes.  
This front obscures what it contains;  
which might be nothing, after all,  
beyond a long and shadowed hall.  
 
But if, tomorrow, it were gone?  
If behind a well-kept lawn   
the store became a charming house,  
where some girl in a flowered blouse  
sat on the porch, forlorn—would I  
notice? If I commuted by  
the sea, long grass and shining shore,  
instead of the uncertain store?  

I don't think I would ever see—  
My eyes are always home to thee.  

She Must Accept Some Swirling Ink
---------------------------------

**May 2010**

Before the caustic brute she cowers.  
It shudders with stone and towers.  
She's plain; Her simple orbs observe  
horizons as flat, and fervor  
as unbecoming. She is fear,  
a place to hide as it grows near.  

she cowers Yet, for the beast roils  
with flame and frozen spilled dreams' spoils  
with mares of night, and ocean night.  
It's stronger in its chaos - flight  
not possibile. Before and since  
it lies, both dawn and dusk a fence.  

Her eyes must drink it to survive,  
she must stop stalling, and arrive.  
She must accept some swirling ink  
into her milk, and sigh, and drink.  

The Kingly State
----------------

**October 2008**

When from the moon, I look below,  
Where thousands, standing for the show,  
Hold up their signs, just green or red,  
Or blue if tears must win instead,  
And faithfully they make a scene,  
And faithfully, a tired screen,  

I cannot help but sit a spell,  
And put the pen back in the well.  
A world so eager to proclaim  
No innocence, or shoulder blame,  
Is far too easy to abstract,  
By pen or by a networked act.  

This world deserves no confidence,  
And I'll give it no drooling trance.  
I pick and choose which worlds to love.  
I stare at her from far above.  
I have that power as of late,  
The crown is mine, the kingly state.
