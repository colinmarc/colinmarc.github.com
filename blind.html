<p class="date"><em>January 2014</em></p>

<p>Will stepped out into the cold air one October afternoon and was surprised to find the campus square had become all brown and grey when he wasn’t paying attention. He was pretty sure it had been green just a few weeks ago, when he had moved in, and it was much colder than it was supposed to be. Peering at the twiggy trees with their scarves of leaves and the stale grass, he wondered—how many things changed quietly like this, without him noticing?</p>

<p>He pulled at the edges of this idea as he walked, thinking on the hidden machinery of the world, not just the natural machinery but the plumbing and electric and roads and governments and everything. And of the children withering and dying in Africa, or wherever, and how he was blind to that, self-absorbed, like he was to the trees and the grass of his quad.</p>

<p>A sudden shout brought this train of thought to a jolting halt, and a few seconds later he realized it was directed at him. It had been the call of his name. He stopped, now a good 15 feet past the source, and turned around to see someone from his high school, a familiar face. He walked back towards her. She was standing outside the entrance to the pool/gym, a duffel by her feet, wearing a baggy WILBUR sweater and some sort of jogging pants—not the most flattering, but she had a bright face and narrow eyes, and curly brown hair that looked damp and heavy. He didn’t remember her name.</p>

<p>She smiled at his delayed reaction as he walked back. “Will! Hey! I didn’t realize you also ended up here.” She pointed at the ground, indicating, as a whole, this school.</p>

<p>“Oh, uh, yup.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your dorm?”</p>

<p>“Welder, back that way…”</p>

<p>“Ah, cool. Tim is there, right?”</p>

<p>“Mhm.” He remembered her name then—Julia!—and her connection to Tim.</p>

<p>“I’m at Simon. On the hill.”</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>“Cool, well, see you around! You should text me sometime, we can hang out!”</p>

<p>He nodded vaguely, put on his best friendly smile, waved.</p>

<p>“Bye!” She smiled back, picked up her discarded duffel bag, headed the opposite direction.</p>

<p>He went his way, turning the conversation over and over in his mind, exploring its cracks and and edges. This conversation seemed maybe significant (in a big-picture, narrative sense), and that kindled a certain excitement in him. In his mind’s eye, her smile was magnified, multiplied to a sultry snarl, a bright twinkle in her left eye. Blood rushed to and fro in his chest.</p>

<p>He would text her, he decided, soon but not too soon, and meet her at a party with people they didn’t know. He imagined they would talk there, spend the night talking, if only because neither of them knew anyone, would be jostled into the corner by people dancing, above it all, laughing quietly at the drunk people around them, and slowly become closer together in that corner, nowhere to look but down at her breasts or into her glowing face. Her wit—he knew she was witty because of the mischievous slant to her eyes, because her voice was scratchy and husky—they would banter and flirt and he would always be a step behind, a little sheepish, but she would like that and tease him and smile and pat his cheek.</p>

<p>Then they would kiss in some natural obvious moment, and her lips would be soft and have lipstick on them, and he would lean in, his hand around the small of her back. She would draw away and giggle that she was surprised he was a good kisser and then kiss him again enthusiastically, pulling him in, maximizing the surface area where their bodies touched. She would take him back to her dorm room, and wrap her smooth long swimmer’s legs around him, and be more experienced, and take control, cracking jokes and playing games with him.</p>

<p>In the morning they would cuddle, and he would tell her about his dad, and she would play with his hair and wipe his tears, and he would marvel at the strength of her character and of her smooth, tanned shoulders.</p>

<hr />

<p>After class (the entirety of which was consumed by this fantasy), and after returning, shivering, to his dorm, Will stopped by Tim’s room, down the hall from his own, to ask for Julia’s number.</p>

<p>Tim was a friend, if not a close one—their significance to each other had increased by virtue of the fact that they were now at the same college. He had been one of the lazy, media-focused kids that Will had liked to associate with in high school. In groups, they’d swarmed game stores and internet cafes, movie theaters, and the like. Tim was different from his family, soft and easygoing while his older brother and sister were star athletes (Tim’s older sister had been on the swimming team with Julia), and his parents were bankers or something. And he smoked, which he kept a secret from them. He was eager and conspiratorial, happy to help, as was his obligation.</p>

<p>Then Will lay in his dorm bed, did a bit of homework, and played a game on his phone. His roommate, Finn, was conspicuously absent. At 7 or 8 he got a text from a friend inviting him to dinner, so he suited up (this time with a hoodie under his jacket) and headed out.</p>

<p>Karen was a senior, and lived in an apartment off campus, in town. She had been a guide at his orientation, and was determined to take him under her wing. Whenever he came over, she clucked like a hen at the state of his clothing, asked about his classes, sometimes even baked him cookies. At first he had balked at this arrangement of personas, but then he warmed to it and teased her gently like some men tease their mothers. She seemed to like that. She fit the part, too: chubby, taller than him, often wearing an apron, thick curly hair standing up on top of her head.</p>

<p>Her apartment was actually fairly nice. It was that that old, decaying victorian style that is so common in New England, ornate and fading. She had exposed brick for one wall of the kitchen, and the hardwood floors were smooth and not splintery. And she had filled it with stuff, which legitimately impressed him. A vacuum cleaner, nice plates, one of those magnet sets on the fridge with political figures and clothes to dress them up in. She had picked her couch from a store, had had it brought upstairs by (Will imagined) burly deliverymen, eager to please.</p>

<p>Will arrived, and pulled up beside the door without ringing the doorbell. Fishing out his phone, he typed out a text to Julia’s number:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin: 0px 20px">hey, it’s will. was nice to see you today! want to come to a party in east campus on monday night?</pre>

<p>And hit send. Then he composed himself, summoning a cloak of virility and youth and charm, and rang the doorbell.</p>

<p>Tonight, Karen was hosting a dinner party. She hosted lots of dinner parties—very adult ones, with place settings food that she cooked and cheap wine. Besides Will and Karen, this particular dinner party featured Karen’s roommate, Jackie, and Jackie’s boyfriend, Matt. They were, the three of them, seniors, and Will was pleased to be invited to hang out with these upperclassmen. He felt like a starlet of a younger generation.</p>

<p>At the table, places, positions and roles were assumed, with Matt and Will sitting across from the girls. Will quickly warmed to the rhythm of this group. Karen would buzz around the table pouring drinks and serving food, and in doing so absent-mindedly introduce a topic. This would inevitably devolve into Matt and Jackie quibbling good-naturedly, at which point it was Will’s responsibility to diplomatically interject and make everyone laugh. As an additional role, Will was occasionally called upon to laugh conspiratorially with Matt at the girls’ expense.</p>

<p>For example, at some point, Karen asked Matt about his recent trip to Florida:</p>

<p>“Well, the beaches were nice. All those girls in bikinis…”</p>

<p>“You can look, but you can’t touch,” said Jackie, teasingly.</p>

<p>“Wait, you don’t know about the area code rule?”</p>

<p>“What’s the area code rule?” asked Karen.</p>

<p>Will spoke up. “I believe that the area code rule states that after some time—perhaps five days—in a different area code, you effectively become single until you once again enter the area code where your girlfriend or whatever lives”.</p>

<p>Matt grinned at Jackie’s raised eyebrows. “You know I love you, six-oh-three.”</p>

<p>Then Will dutifully laughed along with Matt while Jackie made an exaggerated attempt to kick him under the table. Karen just looked on with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>At some point in the dinner, Jackie wanted to know: “Will, how’s your econ class with Corcoran going?”</p>

<p>Will smiled sheepishly. “I actually haven’t gone since the first class.”</p>

<p>Karen, tutting, was piling dirty dishes into a stack. Wiping her hands, she said, “Corcoran’s a good professor—if you put in the effort, you’ll get a lot out of that class.”</p>

<p>Matt laughed too. “Corcoran? Corcoran’s one of the easiest professors I’ve ever seen. Jackie had him freshman year and got an A, even though she missed half the classes.”</p>

<p>Jackie ignored this, and prodded further. “Why do you skip out on classes, Will? You said last time I saw you that you withdrew from your Japanese class, too.”</p>

<p>“Jackie—Jackie—Don’t be hard on the poor kid!” That was Matt, still chortling.</p>

<p>Will was checking his phone—nothing from Julia yet—but looked up after a few beats. “Well, I could go to class, but I’d rather just get drunk and read”, he said, with the best wry smile he could muster. This was not strictly true, but it sounded right.</p>

<p>“Oh, Will…” Karen smiled. He was glad to be believed.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t drink alone,” she continued. “You’re always welcome to come here and get drunk with me.”</p>

<p>Will smiled back, then lied. “Alright, I will.”</p>

<p>Matt snorted. “Just warn me first. I don’t want to be here for any of your drunk philosophical arguments”, he said, adding air quotes around “philosophical”.</p>

<p>Will didn’t really like Matt—he found him boring, predictable, a bit slimy. He wondered why Jackie, who was cute and seemed smart—she wore glasses, perfectly round, with bangs hanging around them—was not only sleeping with Matt but in fact appeared to be on the Marriage Track. He guessed that some weaker people looked for recognizable patterns in life to avoid making actual choices—go to some decent school, marry someone who you have good sex with, focus on your career. Do what’s easy, predetermined. Avoid risk.</p>

<p>But avoiding normalcy at all costs was a form of weakness too—he was certain that he felt disdain for people who were alternative for the sake of it. He decided in that moment that he respected people who made their own choices, who didn’t dodge identities just to dodge them but evaluated them on their actual merits, who forged their own path through the jungle but (of course) were wise enough to take the footpaths when it suited them. That seemed like a good, moderate conclusion.</p>

<hr />

<p>Later, after Matt and Jackie had gone to bed, Will and Karen stayed up to drink and smoke.  They had dropped the personas, the roleplaying, mostly, to Will’s relief—although they now seemed to be roleplaying something else.</p>

<p>Karen had opened a window behind the couch to let the smoke out, and so to keep warm they draped a blanket over both their feet and sat across from each other, each at one end of the couch. The ashtray sat on the floor, with a little bits of ash sitting around it from when one of them had missed. Will periodically fidgeted with his phone—still no response—and balanced his beer on the back of the couch, above him. He was fairly confident he knew what this was, and what supposed to happen next.</p>

<p>Karen was pontificating. “I guess what I’m saying is… like, with planes. There must be some, just, magic that makes them fly. You know?”</p>

<p>“You don’t believe in science?”</p>

<p>He had positioned his legs on the inside of the couch such that his left knee was brushing hers. At some point he had learned or maybe instinctively knew that touch can be a focal point of attraction, that incidental (presented as accidental) touches can set certain internal mechanisms in motion.</p>

<p>She dragged on her cigarette. “Well, of course I do. But it seems like… like if I’m sitting in one, and I stop and actually think about it, it’ll crash.”</p>

<p>Will didn’t bother pointing out that she probably did that every time. “You think that if everyone in the plane stopped believing that planes can fly, it would stop flying?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Does it have to be everyone? If some random dude still believes it can fly, but everyone else doesn’t, will it wobble but manage to take off?”</p>

<p>She shrugged, drank her beer. He laughed, and moved his leg slightly so that it was touching more of hers. Will liked these talks. He could dart, agile, around the shapes she struggled with, poking at them, tugging at them. His control of conversation, and the fact that she was a senior and three years older than him, helped to confirm his suspicions about his place in the ranking of the world, and hers. He felt no small amount of disdain for her.</p>

<p>“Is that a special to humans? Can dolphins believe in airplanes?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess so. That it’s special to humans, I mean. Also, we built the airplane, so maybe that matters.”</p>

<p>“And what about other sentient aliens? Do their spaceships or whatever fly because they believe in them?”</p>

<p>She leaned her head back, umming. He moved his toes so they were (as if absent-mindedly) gently stroking the outside of her thigh while he fiddled with his phone. If she noticed, she didn’t say anything. No response from either.</p>

<p>He changed topics, suddenly bored. “Do you think humans are special, in general?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Like, in the scale of things, of the universe, we’re just a blip. But maybe if we can make things fly with our minds and ask these questions then we’re here for a reason. Do you think we are?”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in God?” She countered. He was still stroking her thigh with his big toe.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the question, right? Are we just complicated parts of the machinery of the world, or do we actually make decisions for ourself?”</p>

<p>After a long pause in which both of them where silent, Will put down his beer. He reached across unceremoniously, folding himself over his legs, grabbing as romantically as he could for Karen’s face. She leaned back, blocked his hand, eyebrows raised, so he let it fall to her breast instead, and squeezed lightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that what you want?” He refused to hear the resignation in her voice, and got up on his knees, moving towards her on the couch. He moved to kiss her, but she held his face back gently.</p>

<p>“No, no kissing.” This annoyed and perplexed Will, and he tried to kiss her neck, but she stopped him again, held him back. Instead she leaned back and took off her shirt, leaving her bra on, and guided his head downwards. Her skin was smooth to the touch, and covered in stretch marks, each like a weird pale scar. As romantically as he could, Will lightly kissed the tops of her breasts, moving downwards to the frilly edge of her bra. She moaned slightly as he did this, but Will wasn’t sure if it was genuine. Suddenly she told Will to sit back—“I give really good head,” she said—and went down on him.</p>

<p>He leaned back and looked at the ceiling; distracted and uncomfortable, his mind wandered. Why was he here, he wondered? He felt like he had not made a conscious choice, had not actually decided to put himself in this position. It felt like his actions had been decided by some greater power.</p>

<p>After thirty minutes of nothing they both gave up, and he saw himself out. Standing outside in the cold air, feeling a bit relieved, Will checked his phone. Zero texts.</p>

<hr />

<p>Will was walking down the hallway of a school building the next day, trailing his hand against the brick, lockers, brick, lockers, when he started thinking about the previous night, and what had happened with Karen. This bothered him, like a twist in his stomach, so he turned and dived and plummeted down the stairs, two, three, four steps at a time, letting the rushing air knock the thoughts out of his head. On the third flight, he tripped on someone.</p>

<p>After he had steadied himself halfway down the next flight, he turned around and started spewing frantic apologies. The girl, who he recognized as from his math class—short, cropped brown hair, small features—waited patiently for him to finish.</p>

<p>“That’s fine, don’t sweat it. Mind getting my marker, there?” She held up a blue sharpie cap.</p>

<p>Will walked to the next landing and picked up the uncapped marker that had gone flying, brought it back to her. She took it and returned to doodling on her forearm, where some multicolored flower was blooming from her wrist. Will stood there for a moment before realizing that this was a Very Important Moment. His heart rose in his chest.</p>

<p>He sat down next to her—she pretended to have forgotten about him, to be absent-mindedly drawing on her arm, but shifted a bit as he did—and took a breath.</p>

<p>“Sorry about that, again. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“I’m Piper.” She looked up, smiled at him, outstretched the flowery arm. “You?”</p>

<p>He shook it, wondering why they were shaking hands. “Will. We’re in math together.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.” This was a good thing for her to have said. “You’re always playing with your phone”.</p>

<p>“Well, sometimes he’ll just ramble on, you know, and do a bunch more examples, after he’s already explained everything perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, totally. Well, actually, it’s usually helpful for me, because I’m pretty bad at math.”</p>

<p>Will searched for conversation. “What are you doing sitting on the stairs, anyway?”</p>

<p>“My next class is right downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Ah.” Another long silence.</p>

<p>“Do you, um, want to get some food sometime?” Will stammered.</p>

<p>A troubled look flashed across her face. “Um, thanks, but I, uh, I have a boyfriend.”</p>

<p>Will didn’t stop to take this in, but let something automatic at the base of his ribcage take over, and lied. “Oh! I didn’t mean—I mean, I just don’t know a lot of people here, so I thought—“</p>

<p>She cut him off, suddenly flushed. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to—it’s just, you know, sometimes when people ask—“</p>

<p>“Totally. Sorry to bother you.” He started to gather his stuff around him exaggeratedly.</p>

<p>“Ah, jeez, I’m sorry. Listen, I’m going with a friend to this music thing tomorrow afternoon, if you want to come?”</p>

<hr />

<p>Walking a foot off the ground back towards his dorm, Will got a text and stopped to look at it. It was from Julia:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; margin: 0px 20px">hey sorry, I didn’t see this until now. I can’t come on monday, but we should hang out soon!</pre>

<p>He didn’t bother to respond.</p>

<hr />

<p>Will met Piper the next afternoon, outside a small, church-like building on the other side of town. He didn’t own a bike, and it ended up being about a twenty minute walk, so his cheeks were hot and itchy by the time he got there.</p>

<p>She was standing alone in front of the building in a colorful coat and scarf, not seeming to mind the cold  at all - in fact, she seemed excited about it. After they each said hello—Will was secretly pleased to hear that her unnamed friend hadn’t been able to make it—she asked him, “You’re from here, right? Do you think it’ll snow soon?” She outstretched a hand, as if a snowflake might fall into it right then.</p>

<p>He looked up at the sky - it was clear and blue. “I’m from Connecticut. Probably at some point soon, but not today. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m from San Francisco, and I’ve never seen snow. Anyway, let’s go.” She thrust her hand back into her coat and turned, walked, practically skipped, to the front door of the building. Hefting it open, she motioned Will inside. He followed.</p>

<p>Inside, it was one big room, with high ceilings. The walls were exposed wood, one step above a log cabin. Benches were arranged in a large circle around a large empty space in the center of the room. A few older men and women were sitting on the far end, and paid the two of them no mind.</p>

<p>“So… what is this place? Are you taking me to church?” Will asked, once he had followed her to one of the empty benches and sat next to her.</p>

<p>“No—it’s a singing.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“Look.” She bent down and retrieved a worn, cloth-bound book from under the seat, titled “The Sacred Harp”, in flowery script. It was wider than it was tall, and when Piper opened it up, he saw that it was filled with sheet music. It looked fairly normal (as far as he could tell), except that the heads of the notes, instead of being circular, were sometimes triangular or square.</p>

<p>“It’s called shape note singing—see how the notes are different shapes? Do you know how to read music?”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry, the whole point is that everyone sings together, and it’s okay if you don’t know what you’re doing. You’re a tenor, I think - you can sit here with me.”</p>

<p>“How am I supposed to know what to sing?”</p>

<p>“They’ll explain. Don’t worry, it’s easy.”</p>

<p>Soon, more people had filtered in. Will was concerned that the average age of the room was well above fifty, but when he whispered this to Piper, she just giggled.</p>

<p>Now the room was mostly full. Will shifted, uncomfortable, between Piper and an older woman with long black hair who had introduced herself as Beverly. A broad-shouldered middle-aged man with greying temples stood up.</p>

<p>“Hi everyone! Welcome to the Wilbur chapter of the Sacred Harp. I see some new faces here, as usual, so I’ll do my best to explain what’s going on. The song book beneath your seat is an old, traditional book of songs in the tradition of what’s called “shape note” singing. It’s a tradition that dates back to the Colonial days in American History.</p>

<p>“A lot of music made today, just like music back then, is made out to be very difficult. If you’re not a professional singer or musician, then, they say, you’re not good enough to sing. We think that’s nonsense - singing is a personal, wonderful thing, and everyone should do it as much as they want. Shape note music makes it easier to learn, but more importantly, there’s no audience; we sing together for our enjoyment, not as an art form. Sing loud enough that you can’t hear the person next to you.”</p>

<p>He quickly explained the basics of the system. Each shape represented a note on the scale, so that it one could follow along using either the shapes or the position of the notes on the staff. After hearing a few scales, Will found that he had easily built up associations between shapes and sounds, and was able to follow along fairly easily.</p>

<p>With the man in the center leading them, his arm waving up and down to the rhythm, the room launched into song. It was cacophonous—each melodic phrase matched in turn by three others from other parts of the room, every note expelled by the singers with delighted exuberance. It was a battle between the tenor and the bass, the alto and the treble, like cannons responding to cannons. The song seemed to spiral out of control.</p>

<p>Will, hesitant, stayed mostly silent, watching Piper. She, too, was entranced, consumed by the music. Her eyes were half-closed, and her arm raised and fell gently with everyone else’s. She sang loudly, but her voice was not harsh like some of the others’. It was gentle.</p>

<p>After first singing just the syllables (“fa-sol-la-sol-la-fa”), they sang the entire song again, but with the words. This time, the melody coalesced for him a bit more, and he was able to sing along a bit. Will tried his best to follow his part, but he still felt like an outsider to whatever experience the singers, and Piper, shared.</p>

<hr />

<p>The singing lasted for ten more songs, all inaccessible to Will. Afterwards, they went for lunch at a sandwich place on campus, which Piper declared was her favorite place to eat on campus. They ordered, and Will ate in silence while Piper chattered about the singing. Will waited for the most opportune moment he could, and then asked, fumbling around a bit, about her boyfriend, and why he wasn’t there at the singing.</p>

<p>“Oh, David? He lives in San Francisco.”</p>

<p>“You guys dated in high school?” Piper nodded.</p>

<p>“Where is he going to school?” Will asked.</p>

<p>“He’s not, really. He’s a year older than me, and he’s an entrepreneur. Very serious, wears suits all the time, you know.” She smiled. “He said he wanted to come to college with me on the East Coast, but he can’t afford it.”</p>

<p>Long silence. “How often do you guys talk?”</p>

<p>Shrugging, she said, “Pretty often. He’s really busy…” and trailed off.</p>

<p>“Are you worried about drifting apart?” Will asked, probing.</p>

<p>Piper just shrugged again. Will decided to try a different tack, and asked her about her classes. She opened up to this, and talked about how much she loved her freshman seminar (devoted to Shakespeare’s sonnets) and how much she hated the math class they shared, how it made her feel dumb—she seemed to say that a lot. She shyly admitted that she wrote some simple poetry, and promised to show him some. As she talked, she absent-mindedly fingered the rainbow of plastic bracelets on her wrists.</p>

<hr />

<p>As the days got shorter and colder, Will was surprised, and pleased, to discover a growing bond of friendship between them. He made up excuses to spend time with her whenever he could, and she seemed to welcome the attention. He quickly found more and more of his time devoted to spending time with her; he ate lunch with her after their math class (the only class he was currently attending), studied with her for tests, even went to singings with her every once in a while.</p>

<p>In her dorm or his, they often sat together, talked, watched old movies. He would sit with her on the bed, her laptop cradled between them, always a few inches apart, consumed by the thought, the fantasy, of her leaning slightly into him, putting her weight on his shoulder. His eyes would wander to his hands, and he would will them to move around her, but something held him back every time. Once he did put his arm around her neck, acting nonchalantly, but she quickly got up to go to the bathroom and the opportunity was missed.</p>

<p>Everyone assumed they were more than friends, and Will could never bring himself to correct anyone. Finn, coming back drunk one night from some party with beer spilled all down the front of his favorite hoodie, had asked Will whether she was good in bed. “Does she put on The Shins every time you guys fuck?” he had asked, before collapsing in a messy pile of cackling laughter. Will was glad he didn’t have to make up an answer.</p>

<p>He fantasized about her constantly, imagining the softness of her lips and her hands on his back or in his hair. She came to him during the day, interrupting his homework or dancing around his vision while he walked to class, or at night, making him squirm under his blankets, feeling like he was burning them up like a glowing coal. He was in love, he knew he was, he could see the shape of the arc of his life and where it intersected with hers. He had to do something to move the story forward.</p>

<hr />

<p>The first snow of the year was in mid-November, on a Friday night. Finn had gone home to his parents’ house, so Will stayed up late just to watch, from his window, the big white flakes float lazily down. It was impossibly peaceful, and when he held his breath the silence became a quiet roar.</p>

<p>When he woke up the next morning and went to the window again, the quiet had been replaced with a cheerful chatter. He could see lots of other students dancing around in the snow in the quad, starting snowball fights and rolling in the snow.</p>

<p>Will was dressing to join them when he got a text from Piper inviting him to come make a snowman. So he walked down the muddy hallway and out the building, past his celebrating classmates, and down the road towards her dorm. As he rounded the corner towards her building, he immediately spotted her colorful coat, a spot of purple and green standing fifty feet apart from a large gaggle of black and blue. He walked over and saw that she was bent over, trying to push a heap of snow forward.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” He asked her, laughing.</p>

<p>She stood up, gave him a quick hug. ”I’m trying to roll it into a ball. That’s how you make a snowman, right?”</p>

<p>He laughed at this, kneeled down to help her gather snow. There was only about six inches of snow, and it was too powdery and light to really stick together, but together they were able to pile and pack the snow together into something vaguely resembling a three-foot-tall human shape. Triumphant, Piper put her hat on it, and Will took a picture of her with the “snowman” on his phone.</p>

<p>Soon Piper was starting to complain about the cold, so they went upstairs to her room to watch a movie. She was practically jumping around from the cold and from excitement, with red cheeks and bright eyes. Will felt the growing impulse to kiss her, to hold her cold cheeks with his hands, but did nothing.</p>

<p>She told him to make himself at home, and went into the bathroom to shower and change. He busied himself by looking at the papers and books on her desk. It was messy, with piles of notebooks and textbooks around her computer. In one of these piles, buried under a stack of papers, Will stopped to look at a  book with a cartoonish dragon on it, blowing fire at a knight. He didn’t recognize most of the writing on the cover, but at the top was the word “Compilers”, and he recognized it some kind of computer programming book.</p>

<p>It took him a second of confusion before he realized that it was Piper’s, and not left by someone else. It was filled with loose paper, covered notes and diagrams in her loopy handwriting. He was brought back, once again, to his incredible blindness—to Piper’s interests, to the leaves and grass in outside his window. He felt a rush of shame.</p>

<p>He turned to shout, ask her about it, but stopped when he saw that she had left the door ajar to the bathroom. The apartment was completely silent, besides the steady sound of the shower. Was she waiting for him, in there? He imagined her smooth skin under the water, her hair wet, steam rising around her, beckoning him to join her, put his arms around her…</p>

<p>Before he could take a step towards the door, though, he heard the shower stop. He turned to her bed and sat on it, conscious of his breathing.</p>

<p>Piper emerged from the bathroom a few moments later, fully clothed. She smiled at him, grabbed her laptop from the desk, and sat beside and a bit in front of him, opening it. “What do you want to watch? I downloaded a few things—”</p>

<p>In response he leaned forward, turned his head, and planted a long kiss on the warm, wet skin of her neck, below her ear.</p>

<p>She flinched away, turned, confused, towards him. Her cheerful smile melted away. “What… what are you doing?”</p>

<p>He leaned forward to kiss her on the lips, but she pushed him back. “Will, what the fuck?”</p>

<p>Will sat back, confused and frustrated. “I… Don’t you want me to?”</p>

<p>“Uh—you know I have a boyfriend.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just—I really like you, and I thought—“ he trailed off.</p>

<p>Will felt a blush of anger as he looked at her face, confusion and hurt spreading across it. But this anger quickly wilted to shame, and he put his heads in his hands. “Oh god, Piper, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“It’s alright, I guess. You’re… I’m glad we’re friends, Will, but I don’t like you like that.” She patted him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s fine. I’m sorry.” Will sighed a little. “Well, can we still watch a movie?”</p>

<p>“Um, okay.” She sat next to him on the bed, although further away than usual, and started a movie. Will couldn’t even bear to look at the screen.  The room seemed to slowly spin.</p>

<p>Long minutes passed. After a while he leaned over and rested his head on her shoulder. She didn’t say anything, and a few seconds later he turned his head and kissed her on the cheek. “Piper,” he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>She tensed, and shifted away, and then looked back at him squarely, gathering herself. “Will, I think you should probably go.”</p>

<p>He didn’t respond, and leaned forward to kiss her again, and her hands came up to block him, but he pushed them aside, forced through. He kissed her, hard, on the mouth, pushing her back onto the pillows, brought his hands to her face and kissed her again and again, down her cheek, down her neck. She was stiff, unresponsive, and when he sat back up he saw that her eyes were open, frozen into expression that he did not recognize. Then he closed his own eyes, and the door slammed, and she was gone.</p>

<p>After a few seconds or minutes, He grabbed his coat and rushed outside after her. Shivering and blinded by sunlight, he scanned the groups of cheerful students, but she was nowhere among them. They ignored him, or did not see him. They seemed alien to him, each bright and ghostly; he quickly hid his face.</p>

<hr />

<p>The next day, Will took a long walk with Finn to the liquor store in town (there was one on campus, but it was much more likely to closely inspect Finn’s fake ID).  The snow, fresh and new yesterday, was already slushy and dirty from the salting trucks and plows. They plodded through it resignedly, often forced off the sidewalk and into the road by crusty banks.</p>

<p>Will was despondent, and Finn was gruff, big-brotherly, although he was only a few months older. Will had explained what had happened, although he had left out the fact that they had never been together at all, ashamed of the reality of it. If the story seemed incongruous to Finn, he hadn’t said anything.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, sometimes things just don’t work out,” he was saying, for the tenth time.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I just feel like I did everything I was supposed to. Like I did everything right,” Will responded, again.</p>

<p>The conversation paused while a truck carefully maneuvered around them.</p>

<p>“You really liked her, huh?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I think maybe she was it.”</p>

<p>A long pause. “Nah, man. There will be others.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, I guess.” Silently, Will hoped that he was wrong. He felt like a pawn, trapped in a game that did not respect him; a game that he was slowly losing.</p>
