<div id="content" class="container"><h2>Behind Uncertain Doors</h2>

<p><strong>February 2012</strong></p>

<p>The walk to work runs past a store, <br />
with dollar books by a red door, <br />
old wood, with paint that chips; <br />
the flakes stick to the concrete steps, <br />
and pool beneath the smokey windowpanes. <br />
This front obscures what it contains; <br />
which might be nothing, after all, <br />
beyond a long and shadowed hall.  </p>

<p>But if, tomorrow, it were gone? <br />
If behind a well-kept lawn <br />
the store became a charming house, <br />
where some girl in a flowered blouse <br />
sat on the porch, forlorn—would I <br />
notice? If I commuted by <br />
the sea, long grass and shining shore, <br />
instead of the uncertain store?  </p>

<p>I don't think I would ever see— <br />
My eyes are always home to thee.  </p>

<h2>She Must Accept Some Swirling Ink</h2>

<p><strong>May 2010</strong></p>

<p>Before the caustic brute she cowers. <br />
It shudders with stone and towers. <br />
She's plain; Her simple orbs observe <br />
horizons as flat, and fervor <br />
as unbecoming. She is fear, <br />
a place to hide as it grows near.  </p>

<p>she cowers Yet, for the beast roils <br />
with flame and frozen spilled dreams' spoils <br />
with mares of night, and ocean night. <br />
It's stronger in its chaos - flight <br />
not possibile. Before and since <br />
it lies, both dawn and dusk a fence.  </p>

<p>Her eyes must drink it to survive, <br />
she must stop stalling, and arrive. <br />
She must accept some swirling ink <br />
into her milk, and sigh, and drink.  </p>

<h2>The Kingly State</h2>

<p><strong>October 2008</strong></p>

<p>When from the moon, I look below, <br />
Where thousands, standing for the show, <br />
Hold up their signs, just green or red, <br />
Or blue if tears must win instead, <br />
And faithfully they make a scene, <br />
And faithfully, a tired screen,  </p>

<p>I cannot help but sit a spell, <br />
And put the pen back in the well. <br />
A world so eager to proclaim <br />
No innocence, or shoulder blame, <br />
Is far too easy to abstract, <br />
By pen or by a networked act.  </p>

<p>This world deserves no confidence, <br />
And I'll give it no drooling trance. <br />
I pick and choose which worlds to love. <br />
I stare at her from far above. <br />
I have that power as of late, <br />
The crown is mine, the kingly state.  </p>
