There's a character I keep meeting in stories I read. He's a shadow, the text that the author wrote viewed through the warped glass of my own fears. Most recently, I met him in *The Sun Also Rises*, in the character of Jacob Barnes.

In that character, and in others - Meursault comes to mind - there's a blank, empty, unexplained quality to their actions. They are solemn and mechanical - describing their motions through life with a calmness that seems almost absurd when compared to the events that surround them (the sun was in my eyes, says Meursault). They're always watching, always an outsider, an observer, even to their own actions. There's this strange, empty void behind the mask, left for the reader to interpret (or fill).

My biological father is another such shadow. I never met him (and won't - he committed suicide when I was in high school), but I've heard quite a bit about him. Everything I've been told paints this picture of a person who went from one life to the next, behaving perfunctorily because that's all he knew how to do, never truly connecting to anything or anyone. People who came to love him felt used, because he never really showed them love in return.

Perhaps there was something that caused him to act that way - but who knows? Because I've never heard his story from any other perspective (and never from his own), I'm left with the same empty, emotionless void where the emotional context of his actions should be.

Whenever I think about it, my own insecurity goes rushing into that void like air into a vacuum - I look for parallels in my own life and my own behavior. Am I the same? Do I act that way? I've certainly hurt people before, by being inconsiderate and self-centered.

He's not really a person to me - he's a haunting concept, a version of myself that I'm afraid I'll become, if I don't pay attention. He's a set of qualities I see in myself in my worst moments.

Modern life gives us this incredible structure to live by. I was born a straight, white, cis-gendered male in Massachusetts; I need only let myself pour, molten, into any number of molds arrayed before me and have my entire life prescribed. I could go many years without making any actual choices, and no one would be the wiser. And I have! In some ways, I've forgone real choice so far.

How many people go to school where their parents tell them to, take the first job that seems reasonable, and marry the first person who's nice to them? In America, in the 21st century, most people would say that we've made great strides to allow individuality and social mobility. I don't know if I believe that.

It's really easy to pick an identity off the shelf - douchey banker, breathless technologist, family man. It's harder to cobble one together, to be part of many things and connect to many people. It's much harder still to forge your own, so much that we consider it the mark of a great person, the ability to defy and define convention. How rare are those people?

*Sonder* is a lovely concept that I only learned recently. The definition, from *The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows*:

> sonder (n.) the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

Human beings have incredible depth. The more you zoom in on a person's motivation for something, the more detail (and therefore ambiguity) can be discovered. No act stands on its own, but is instead a thread within an incredible tapestry.

No - my arrogance about the one-dimensionality and simple choicelessness of others' lives, and my reduction of my father's life into just the harm he's caused to people I love, are purely self-centeredness on my part. Both reflect a lack of sonder. I think I might enjoy reading Hemingway more, or understand my father a little more, if I stop projecting myself into places where it's not necessarily relevant to do so.
