<div id="content" class="container"><h2>Silence</h2>

<p><em>July 2013</em></p>

<p><em>The idea for this story is stolen from an NPR story broadcast thing I heard once. The memory of the time I heard it is fresh; I remember the warm air coming through the open windows of the car, the person I was with, the scenery I stared distractedly at - everything except for the name of the story itself. If you know the name of it, please email me.</em></p>

<p>New York City, 2004. August 2nd, 5:45 PM.</p>

<p>Heat and water choke the air, causing it to lie heavy, like a blanket, over the bustling city. If you were to (by some feat of magic or technology) hover passively between two skyscrapers, hundreds of feet in the air, the cacophany below might seem subdued and muffled.</p>

<p>From the ground, though, the noise is deafening. Endless taxis hack and shudder through the thick air. Trucks rumble slowly down the main streets, wincing to a halt whenever a pedestrian crosses their path. Crowds of commuters rush to and fro, overclothed in suit and tie, sweating and uncomfortable in the oppressive heat. Some of these professionals haul their suitcases and backpacks into stuffy subway stations, shoes clapping on the marble steps, breathing heavily for what feels like scarcity of breathable air. They're greeted by the whine and screech of aluminum-clad trains, scraping along dirty tracks in dark, echoing tunnels.</p>

<p>Others sit in cooled bars and coffee shops, straining to hear and be heard over the even hum of overworked AC systems. Or in bars, where the clashing chatter and laughter of the crowd forms one loud sound that bubbles up and threatens to boil over its confines.</p>

<p>Until, for just a few moments, there is complete and utter silence.</p>

<p>For a precious ten seconds, some supernatural event causes every taxi to stall and every truck to grind to a halt. All of the commuters simultaneously startle, balancing mid-stride as if taken by a sudden thought or memory. The racous laughter in bars becomes hushed and trails off, replaced with a still confusion.</p>

<p>It's not just a sudden hush, but total and complete silence. No birds can be heard, or barking dogs; no scrape of leaves on concrete, or rustle of branches; no beep or ringtone or vibrating phone. Everything stops, and the silence comes rushing in like a powerful sound itself.</p>

<p>After what seems like an eternity, the moment passes, and slowly, the bustle of the city rises up again. Confused citydwellers turn to their friends, trying to figure out if they just fell out of existence for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Did that just happen?" whispers one. "Uh, yeah," says another, perplexed. Then they sit, unsure of what more to say about it.</p>

<p>Across the city, life returns to normal. News anchors dwell on the event for a few weeks, a stunning length of focus for a news cycle that usually lives and dies in hour-long increments. "Top scientists" are dispatched to study the phenomenon, and try to discern the source. The silence was mostly limited to Manhattan, it is learned, although things seemed to have quieted down a bit in parts of Brooklyn and Queens. There are no injuries reported to have been caused by the sudden gap (as it comes to be known).</p>

<p>And although most New Yorkers, preoccupied as they are with the hectic pace of their lives, soon put the event out of their mind, some find themselves missing it, seeking it again. At night, people find themselves braving the heat and turns off their fan or their AC because they find the garish sound unbearable.</p>

<p>Subtly, an obsession with silence seeps into the subconcious of the residents of Manhattan. Restaurants that were once lively and excited become hushed, filled only with scratchy whispers of conversation. At the tables, diners pick gently at their food, careful to avoid the clash of silverware or ceramics. A waiter carelessly drops a glass, and the resulting crash is met with a collective wince from the patrons. He shuts his eyes tightly, burning with shame, not breathing, waiting for the silence to return.</p>

<p>Public action is taken. Whispering arguments over the delicate tap of a gavel, city legislators quietly enact laws to shush all ambient noise. Subway trains have their engines oiled and insulated so they can glide, with a gentle woosh, through padded tunnels. Electric cars make a huge comeback, and most of the city's taxi fleets are switched out (residents refuse to ride in the old taxis, cringing at their offensive noise). Cellphones are categorically silenced; the younder and more technologically inclined are enlisted help their parents and grandparents find the setting for button press volume.</p>

<p>Even in private, talking on the phone is considered extremely rude, reserved for only the most severe emergencies. Texting and email are overwhelmingly used instead, even when the person is in the next room. People retreat even more into the internet, typing gently on special keyboards.</p>

<p>Gun violence all but disappears - the assault of a gunshot on the ears is too much to bear. The hot-blooded are afraid to raise their voices, and become timid.</p>

<p>Musicians lose their love for music.</p>

<p>Independent rock bands, street guitarists and singers, DJs in clubs - all disappear in short order. Pianos are closed, violins are unstrung. The New York Philharmonic completely disbands. Stand up comedy becomes scarce,performed in whispers to wheezed giggles. Slam poetry is harder to find.</p>
