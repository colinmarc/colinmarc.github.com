<div id="content" class="container"><h1>Microwave Literacy </h1>

<p><em>(this is a quasi-rebuttal to Jeff Atwood's post
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/please-dont-learn-to-code.html">"Please Don't Learn to Code."</a>. If you're bored of the topic, you might want to stop
reading. I'll try to be broader.)</em></p>

<p>I know hundreds, maybe thousands of languages. I'm not talking about spoken
languages, or programming languages, although I'll talk about those in a bit.
I'm talking about languages of operation.</p>

<p>What does that mean? Well, I know how to talk to my phone. I know how to talk
to my microwave. And my TV. Individual apps in on my phone have their own
languages (one of the problems that android has yet to solve), and I know each
of them.</p>

<p>There are common elements of these languages, to be sure; I know a button when
I see it, and a menu, and an 'x' in a circle usually means close or quit. Just
as there are common elements in Latin-based languages, there are common
elements to user interface design.</p>

<p>Imagine, for a second, a world where spoken languages were far less
standardized. Instead of being able to write and speak english everywhere in
the U.S., each state has its own language. Actually, every town and city has
its own language. As you travel around, each time you visit a new place, you
learn the local phrases and expressions you need.</p>

<p>That's where we are with the technology in our lives. While written language is pretty
solidified, the languages of operation are horribly fragmented and rapidly
evolving. The car I'm in right now has some dashboard interface that is
completely incomprehensible until you spend 30 minutes with it.  It's easier
than learning korean, but still difficult. </p>

<p>And I don't think that's just a user interface problem. I think it's a
<strong>literacy</strong> problem. Devices and people don't share any common language.</p>

<p>There is one language that me, my TV, my microwave, and the dashboard in this
car all speak, in one form or another: code. Well, sort of. </p>

<p>Let me back up a second. Let's say I want to pop some popcorn for a night of
sniffling over <em>The Notebook</em>. My microwave's interface is extremely low-level.
The information it really wants is "how long do I cook this for? How much power
do I use?". To give it that information, I press a bunch of digits. I mess that
part up pretty often. I'm converting the information into mechanical symbols,
and then entering those symbols physically, and then the microwave is
converting that information back into the concepts it understands.</p>

<p>You probably see where I'm going with this. Of course, it wouldn't really be
practical to type in the ip address of my microwave into my phone, and then
type this:</p>

<pre><code>{ 'time': 200, 'power': 3 }
</code></pre>

<p>and then hit send. But effectively, that would allow a seperation of concerns.
Allow that, and there are now two parts of the process of popping popcorn. The
microwave speaks exactly the concepts it needs to, and I can communicate those
concepts however I want: hand-written JSON, a web/mobile app (microwave.ly?),
brain-reading alien slugs that connect to wifi, whatever. To a programmer, the
benefits of this are obvious.</p>

<p>(This doesn't just apply to devices, of course. People have been writing web
apps services with APIs and reaping the benefits for years.)</p>

<p>Ok, so what do we need to get there? It's simple - everyone needs to learn to
code. No big deal, right? Common technological literacy will allow people
making the microwaves to expose an API instead of adding clunky buttons. I
think Mr. and Mrs. Microwave would rather create simpler devices and not worry
about creating a user interface. Maybe that's too optimistic, because API
design is hard too.</p>

<p>This isn't a call to action. We surround ourselves with devices and services,
so I think that we'll naturally develop a language to speak with them. But
knowing how to program puts you ahead of the curve. So please, learn to
code!</p>
