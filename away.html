<p class="date"><em>March 2013</em></p>

<p>his eyes fell, like his broken sighs <br />
or, perhaps, raised, to blue-black skies <br />
where angels only he could reach <br />
and very few would even seek <br />
cavorted; but if it was woe, <br />
or merely something hidden, so? <br />
he looked away, away, away, <br />
and that's the only thing - away.  </p>

<p>a narrative born on the moon <br />
with radiant hair and face in bloom <br />
swept down from high with brandished sword <br />
but found herself unjust, abhorred <br />
and given by a broken lord <br />
a broken cord, a sultry chord. <br />
so then that story went away, <br />
to find, and save, a different day.  </p>

<p>a darkness, then, which seeped unseen, <br />
brought warriors, wrought in gutted dreams <br />
who fought and brayed and prayed to crowds <br />
of fiends within his mind. too loud, <br />
he thought, to think! the wave clattered, <br />
flattered, battered, bled and shattered, <br />
left of its own accord. at bay, <br />
the chaos went away, away.  </p>

<p>he drew a bead on silence, then, <br />
and focused on the thread again. <br />
above horizon, and below, <br />
there roiled fire, corpse and crow. <br />
he's safe until he looks away, <br />
some day, whether to skies or fey, away.  </p>
